    \n
    This project based on the [Food101](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) Paper which used Convolutional network trained for 2 to 3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.
    The project is made by download the food101 dataset from the [TensorFlow dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101)(size: 4.6GB) which consists of 750 images x 101 training classes = 75750 training images.
    I used the [EfficientNetB0](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB0) model with fine-tune unfreeze all layers of the model. \n
    Although this WebApp model accuracy is around 80% to 82%. I am also sharing the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15sJJhrZBo12CA3flnrX-NC4WwrP84z0D?usp=sharing) for this project.
